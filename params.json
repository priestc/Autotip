{"name":"Autotip","tagline":"Decentralized cryptocurrency microtipping platform","body":"Autotip is an:\r\n\r\n* Open source Google Chrome extension.\r\n* Alternate way for content creators (bloggers, forums posters, artists) to monitize their content.\r\n* HTML5 standards compliant convention (official inclusion to the HTML standard is pending).\r\n* works for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin, Litecoin and many others.\r\n* is configurable to be sent automatically on each pageload, or only by prompt.\r\n\r\nThis project written for the Miami Bitcoin hackathon on January 9-10, 2015.\r\n\r\n## Setup for tippers\r\n\r\nSearch for Autotip in the chrome extension store. Once you've installed it, open up the\r\nextensions page by navigating to chrome:extensions:\r\n\r\n![screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/8IkKdBK.png?1)\r\n\r\nNow click on the options link:\r\n\r\n![screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/gximsVJ.png?1)\r\n\r\nYou'll see a deposit address near the bottom. Send a small amount of bitcoin to this\r\naddress. Less than $25 worth of bitcoin is recommended. This extension was not built with\r\nextreme security in mind, so it is advised to not hold large amounts in the extension.\r\n\r\n![screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/8ZOpWOk.png)\r\n\r\nOnce the bitcoins have been sent, you'll see the balance show below the private key.\r\n\r\nNow whenever you load a page that has been set up to use the Autotip standard,\r\nyour browser will automatically send a very small \"microtip\" (usually 5 cents or less)\r\nto the person who created the content on the page.\r\n\r\n## Setup for content creators\r\n\r\nLets say you're a blogger. You would like to earm money from the audience that reads your blogs.\r\nOne way to do this is to put ads on your site. Ads can be easily blocked, and for users\r\nwho don't block them, they are annoying to look at.\r\n\r\nGetting started using the platform is as easy as adding a snippet of code to every\r\npage that contains content.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the HTML document of your blog's header, you can add a meta take like this:\r\n\r\n    <meta name=\"microtip\" content=\"1HWpyFJ7N6rvFkq3ZCMiFnqM6hviNFmG5X\" data-currency='btc' data-recipient=\"John Doe\">\r\n\r\n(Replace the value of `content` with your actual bitcoin address. To get started with bitcoin, go to [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/).\r\n\r\nYou can also use altcoin addresses:\r\n\r\n    <meta name=\"microtip\" content=\"Lb78JDGxMcih1gs3AirMeRW6jaG5V9hwFZ\" data-currency='ltc'>\r\n\r\n# multiple tipping addresses per page\r\n\r\nThe standard also permits the use of multiple tip addresses. In the case that the extension finds\r\nmultiple tip addresses, the tip gets split amoung each address equally.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this extension does not support sending tips to altcoin addresses, but support is planned.\r\n\r\n## APIs used\r\n\r\nThis extension uses the following APIs:\r\n\r\n* Bitcore - creating transactions, generating the deposit address\r\n* Blockr.io - getting unspent outputs, pushing raw transaction to the network\r\n* winkdex- getting current exchange rate\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
